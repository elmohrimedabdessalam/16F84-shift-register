# 16F84-shift-register
  In order to create an embedded solution, some applications require many LEDs, seven segments, actuators, and sensors. in this case, required a microcontroller with many GPIOs. another way is to use a shift register, I proposed an algorithm based on the timer interrupt that allows getting an optimized code. I apply this algorithm in PIC 16F84, I use XC8 as compiler. In this repo contain MPLAB project, and Proteus simulation file.
